All scripts in this project are intended to run on Linux (specifically CentOS 7) in a command-line interface (CLI) only environment.

Do not start to rewrite code unless the user says so.

- The target environment runs Python 3.11.
- The `pandas` and `asyncssh` libraries are confirmed to be installed on the target Linux machine.
- The `get_pdkey` function's interactive input will not be an issue in the intended environment.
- The `PDRIVE` variable is a placeholder and will be manually updated on the target system.
