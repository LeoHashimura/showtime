fix: Finalize error handling and logout logic

- Restored the Telnet login sequence that was accidentally removed.
- Implemented a robust, two-step (exit/logout) procedure to handle devices that do not close the connection correctly.
- Added a new 'logout_failed' status (magenta) for visual feedback.
